Vesta Healthcare is a startup with a simple mission: Delivering extraordinary outcomes by unlocking the power of caregivers. Caregivers are one of the largest, most untapped resources in the healthcare delivery system and are the unsung heroes of their care recipients. Yet despite their vital role, they are largely unsupported and invisible to the healthcare ecosystem.

At Vesta Healthcare, we enable people with personal assistance to thrive at home, in their community by assuring the people they rely on, their caregivers, have the resources, data, and support they need. We achieve this through a combination of analytics, technology, services, and deep healthcare expertise. Our analytics help identify and target the right people and populations. Our technology creates real-time connectivity and actionable data out of observations. Our services connect to real people who can help when needs arise, and our healthcare expertise helps us understand how we create value for both payers and providers.

Our program monitors in real-time, identifying issues before they become health events, and helping connect those in need with those who can help via technologies such as video, chat, and telephone. Our technology platform includes home-based mobile applications, a clinical dashboard, and data analytics on data not previously available to health professionals. We are disrupting a $109 billion industry and have just closed our latest funding round with a blue-chip list of investors.

Our team is passionate, driven, collaborative, intellectually curious, and excited about the opportunity to transform our healthcare system. We're inspired by caregivers and seek to create a platform that recognizes, utilizes and supports the vital role they play. We strive to continuously learn, explore, experiment and achieve results.

About USAC:
Through its administration of the $10 billion Universal Service Fund (USF) programs on behalf of the FCC, USAC works to promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable and affordable rates and to increase access to advanced telecommunications services throughout the nation. Specifically, the USF programs provide funding for the expansion of telecommunications and broadband access to rural communities and health care facilities, schools and libraries across the country, and low income households. Through program administration, auditing, and outreach, USAC works with contributors, service providers, and program beneficiaries to achieve the program goals articulated by the FCC for each of these programs.
The FCC has reformed the USF to support further investment in and access to evolving broadband infrastructure, making the programs a primary vehicle to support this critical national priority. USAC, as the administrator of the USF, plays a critical role in supporting the ambitious vision to ensure that all citizens in the United States have access to high-speed broadband. The organization has approximately 500 employees with an operating budget of more than $200 million. USAC works in close partnership with the FCC and other federal and state partners to support the achievement of the USF program goals.
USAC administers the USF programs—High Cost, Lifeline, Rural Health Care, and Schools and Libraries. USAC strives to provide efficient, responsible stewardship of the programs, a key national asset in making important telecommunications and Internet services available to consumers, health care providers, schools, and libraries throughout the United States. The program divisions are supported by additional USAC personnel in Finance, General Counsel, Information Systems, Internal Audit, the Enterprise Program Management Office and Human Resources.

Universal service is paid for by contributions from telecommunications carriers, including wireline and wireless companies, and interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol providers, including cable companies that provide voice service, based on an assessment of their interstate and international end- user revenues. These contributions are most typically passed through to consumers through a universal service fee line item on their telephone bills.

We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects.

We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Marketing Data Analyst,"Hillsboro, OR",Course5 Intelligence,None,"Job description:
It has become increasingly apparent that in representing the end-user, a greater emphasis needs to be placed on integrating non-traditional primary research data into its insights generation process (e.g. web behavior, social media listening, search, etc.). Integrating these different (and at times unstructured) data sources with traditional primary research data (e.g. survey-based data, focus groups, etc.) is becoming critical in driving a data driven culture into Intel's marketing efforts, including driving more effective media targeting and spending; and the build out of predictive models designed to increase the sales efficiency of our marketing campaigns.

Responsibilities:
The Marketing Data Analyst position requires in-depth data analytics knowledge and expertise. This position requires experience with extracting data from relational databases (using SAS, SQL or alike) as well as familiarity with enterprise level web analytics tools (e.g., Adobe Omniture, Google Analytics Premium, Web Trends, etc.). Experience with digital media planning, optimization and measurement and familiarity of media tools such as DART, Atlas, MediaMind, etc. is a plus.

This position is also involved in client's pursuit of increasingly using unstructured (so-called ""big data"") and structured data with ultimate goal to connect marketing investments to sales and develop predictive analytics capability. Responsibilities include partnering with Intel IT (or vendors) to translate business requirements into technical data pull requirements. Once initial data extract is performed, further data summarization, manipulation and interpretation is necessary in order to deliver analytical insights and recommendations.
Pulling together results in a digestible manner (e.g. not massive amounts of data but a narrative) that outlines key takeaways and recommendations will be extremely important. Equally essential, the ability to present findings [narrative] to internal teams (and at times, senior executives) that drives action, improvements, and accountability.
Desired Skills and Experience:
Graduate or undergraduate degree with quantitative focus such as Economics, Statistics, Mathematics, Decision Science, Operational Research, or Engineering
5+ years of experience in analytics used to optimize multi-channel (including on-line) marketing strategy and campaigns
Experience with data mining software packages such as R, SAS, SPLUS, SQL and statistical algorithms typically used in Marketing Analytics
Experience and interest in data visualization, reporting, and tool building in order to scale operations and increase visibility to the data/results
Understanding of enterprise level web analytics tools and underlying data (e.g., Adobe Omniture, Google Analytics Premium, Web Trends, etc.)
Excellent team player with the ability to build strong working relationships with key partners and business leads.
Actively listens, understands, and values other's views
High performance individual with demonstrated ability to manage extremely complex projects with tight deadlines
Exceptional presentation skills, including proven success in developing presentations that requires taking complex data sets, and boiling down into visual, meaningful and understandable insights and recommendations (e.g. presenting a narrative or story versus dumping large amounts of data)
A passion for driving insights into action, including genuine excitement about the opportunity that Big Data present

About Go
We're building the world’s first Social Life platform; it’s called Go. Use it to plan some binge-watching of a Netflix series with a buddy, have a potluck with your close friends, plan a great night out with a date, see a concert, make it on time for the best happy hour you never knew about with old friends, or find and enroll in a nearby yoga (or boxing, or rock climbing…) class that fits perfectly in your schedule. If you’re feeling adventurous, check out a list of the best stuff happening in your city that you love or are visiting, or explore new activities that you’ve always wanted to experience but don’t know where to start (and don’t have time and motivation to research it all on the internet).
All of that ‘stuff’, well, it’s what makes our worlds go-round; because that’s what life is about. Friends. Family. Community. Love. Adventure. So, instead of staring down at a smartphone at all hours of the day opining on things that your community has already done. Go creates a world where every post on your feed is something you can actually go and do. A platform that helps you plan and coordinate and get out there. Off the screen and into the fray of real life. That’s Go.
We’re not gonna lie: Go is early-stage. But we’re funded, led by an incredible, passionate, and prestigious team, and have a product that very well may make the world a better place. We’re not Uber for cats, or some weird new drink or delivery service. We’re attempting to solve the monumental problem of social rift. We believe that a path back from a post-fact, post-community world is one that starts with a cup of coffee with an old friend. Or a bike ride. Any time you’re off you’re social media feeds and hanging out with others. A technology company devoted to making life better through empowering people to build and enrich real-life relationships with friends, family, and community.
Go is founded on the belief that a healthy social life is fundamentally made up of two things: spending time with people and doing the things that you want to do. It’s that simple: People should do what they love and be free to live the best life possible. Social technology should help us in real life by promoting human agency and self-actualization, and must stand against exploitation and the monetisation of its users and their personal data. Our world and environment has untapped and unknown richness, beauty and potential. Happiness is contagious whether found through extraordinary events or shared simple and mundane experiences. Tech can help happiness grow and make life better - in the real world.

Topological Data Analyst Intern
Summer of Topological Data Analyst (SOTDA) Intern
The Summer of TDA (SoTDA) is now accepting applications for a ten-week internship running 1 Jun 2020 - 7 Aug 2020. We are currently seeking students (undergrad, masters, or Ph.D) or recently graduated individuals (within 1 year with similar degrees) who have a background in computer science, computer engineering, data science or related fields with additional experience or exposure to machine learning, statistics, and data visualization. Exposure or course work related to Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is preferred, but not required. The 10-week long internship will focus on advancing state-of-the-art TDA approaches as the principle methodology for creating explainable artificial intelligent (XAI) demonstrations across a number of data challenges. Interns will work closely with Air Force Research Laboratory government mentors, industry partners, and academic collaborators to formulate innovative solutions to challenging, big-data problems. Guest speakers across government, industry, and academia will deliver both instruction and guest lectures throughout the duration of the program. The ten-week ""hack-a-thon"" will be centered at the Wright Brother's Institute, 2nd Street Location, in the heart of downtown Dayton. This location, called Project 444, is an open air workspace where selected interns will work daily in multidisciplinary teams, while having easy access to the growing downtown economic redevelopment area.
WHO : Current or recently graduated undergraduate or graduate students may apply
WHAT : Immersive 10-week course in Topological Data Analysis with machine learning and visualization integration
WHEN : 1 Jun 2020 - 7 Aug 2020
WHERE : Wright Brother's Institute, Project 444, 2nd Street, Downtown Dayton, OH
PAY : $20/hr Accepted interns will become employees of KBR over the duration of the internship
HOUSING : Multiple options for housing will be available, but it will be up to the interns to secure housing during the internship. Downtown apartments, long term Airbnb, or lower cost dorm rooms at Wright-State University will be available.
Application deadline is April 10, 2020. In addition to filling out the required on-line information, please provide a PDF resume with 1-2 additional references. Consideration for internship is limited to U.S. citizens and green card holders/permanent residents and status should be included within the application.
Executive Summary.
Currently across almost all sectors of government, academia, and industry, we are witnessing wide-scale integration of machine learning and artificial intelligent approaches that intend to dramatically impact data-to-decision speeds. Within this domain, a number of different approaches are being rapidly matured to match the exponential growth in data. In the Air Force Research Laboratory, 711th Human Performance Wing Airman Systems Directorate, we are developing advanced methods utilizing the mathematical underpinnings of topological data analysis (TDA) to autonomously architect and exploit solutions to challenging big-data problems. Some of these applications have revealed potentially paradigm-shifting advances across domains that include automated target recognition, persistent physiological and cognitive monitoring, Air Force-wide force health monitoring capabilities, image analytics, and rapid multi-modal data fusion. In our approaches, we are constructing thousands of connected TDA models in an ensemble analytical framework that forms the basis for an explainable artificial intelligent approach (XAI). This XAI approach gives the prediction and classification accuracies seen in the best performing black-box machine learning approaches, while retaining a fully explainable architecture that can be continuously mined for non-hypothesized understanding, uncover and prioritize hidden correlations in the data, increase trust in derived solutions, provide a framework for data visualization, and ensure that the underlying machine learning solution is obeying commander's intent.
The Summer of TDA program, Jun 1 – Aug 7 2020, seeks to rapidly mature TDA efforts being developed within the 711thHPW/RH in coordination with multiple universities, government agencies, and industry. We wish to invite 20-30 interns to be hosted at Wright Brothers Institute, an adjunct off-site facility near Wright-Patterson AFB. The goals include: (1) developing end-to-end TDA XAI methodologies for the most challenging data sets where sponsors require the precision of machine learning and explainability of the solution space, (2) develop bio-inspired strategies for rationally architecting and connecting millions of ensemble topological models into an integrated AI framework, (3) rapidly instantiate, test, validate, and deliver an advanced technology demonstration highlighting XAI and TDA integration coupled with dynamic visualization and immersive environments, and (4) strategically identify, develop, and recruit the future workforce who have competency in this rapidly emerging area. Additionally, the Summer of TDA promotes the creation of a multidisciplinary/multi-institutional center of gravity where collaborators can convene, work together, and develop next-generation XAI approaches that have significant benefit to the U.S. Department of Defense.

Product management. We're not talking about ""agile product owner"" nonsense. We mean real product management work where shape and lay out the product strategy and roadmap to drive business results that matter.
Being obsessively customer focused.
Delivering an amazing user experience.
Getting product to market. We mean really fast. Even for a company at our scale.
Forget scrum, XP, Kanban, whatever. We have our own unique flavor of agile. And it totally works.
Driving revenue and ROI. We're not sales, marketing, account management, or customer success. But make no mistake: We Drive The Business.
What will you be doing? You'll be responsible for turning data into information and information into insights that will help us make critical business decisions to drive our product strategy.

You can be hands-on. All of us contribute as individuals. Yes, as Product Management, we craft the product strategy. We also roll up our sleeves and get in the trenches to get things done. If you're looking to manage a team day 1, have a fancy title, or need a corner office, this won't be the right fit for you.
You're comfortable in a fast-paced environment. If you're not comfortable in an environment where change is constant, if you value fancy desks and a predictable work schedule, you won't be happy here.
You thrive on growth. This is an opportunity to work in a fast-growing market on major business challenges. You'll have the support of passionate, experienced co-workers, but our biggest challenges lie ahead of us. You'll play a key role in finding and delivering answers.

Why Clarity Insights, Why Consulting and Why Now?
We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together.
