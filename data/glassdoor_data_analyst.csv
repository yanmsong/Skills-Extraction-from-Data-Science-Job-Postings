CentralReach was developed for Clinicians by Clinicians. The story of CentralReach begins at an ABA clinic based out of Pompano Beach, Florida. The company’s founder, a practicing Board Certified Behavioral Analyst, was drowning in manual management of her clinic from scheduling staff and filing claims to reporting on clinical data. She decided that there had to be a better way to manage her operations so she could spend more time on what mattered most — working with her clients and patients. To help ABA practices focus on what they do best, CentralReach launched the first iteration of its EHR and practice management platform in 2012.

Its mission is to monitor global health conditions and health systems, as well as to evaluate interventions, initiatives, and reforms. IHME carries out a range of projects within different research areas including: the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD); Future Health Scenarios; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Local Burden of Disease; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. The aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.

IHME has an exciting opportunity for a Data Analyst on the Reproductive, Genitourinary, and Digestive (RGUD) team. A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, researchers, and the communities they serve with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health. Within this broader enterprise, the Reproductive, Genitourinary, and Digestive (RGUD) team quantifies fatal and nonfatal health loss due to diverse conditions such as complications of pregnancy and childbirth, sexually transmitted infections, infertility, other conditions of the reproductive and urinary organs, viral hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other gastrointestinal disorders.

A Data Analyst on our team must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple RGUD projects. The Data Analyst must be able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data. The position calls for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages – Stata, R, and Python, with special emphasis on Python.

With an annual budget of $1.6 billion and more than 6,000 employees throughout the five boroughs, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) is one of the largest public health agencies in the world, serving 8 million New Yorkers from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. With over 200 years of leadership in the field, we're also one of our nation's oldest public health agencies. The challenges we face range from obesity, diabetes and heart disease to HIV/AIDS, tobacco addiction and substance abuse, and the threat of bioterrorism. We're tackling these issues with innovative policies and programs and getting exceptional results, but our work is never finished. The breadth of our innovative programs provides the widest range of choices for every member of our team.

Program Overview

The Division of Disease Control (DDC) at the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) is responsible for the identification, surveillance, treatment, control and prevention of infectious diseases in NYC.

Surveillance teams across the DDC bureaus collectively monitor and investigate over 90 reportable infectious diseases to detect, characterize, and respond to threats.

DDC continuously enhances its electronic systems in order to improve completeness of data and respond to emergent infectious agent threats (e.g., Zika virus, Ebola). More recently, DDC has embarked on an initiative to improve the interoperability of its surveillance informatics infrastructure by leveraging national health data standards. This will facilitate exchange with partners including healthcare providers, laboratories, health information exchanges (HIEs) such as the regional health information organizations (RHIOs), and other government agencies.

Additionally, they will gain more knowledge of DOHMH surveillance by assisting in project coordination, management and evaluation as necessary.

The selected candidate will be an employee of Public Health Solutions (PHS), a non-profit organization that is the fiscal manager for DOHMH. This position is a 2 year position, paid for by 90/10 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act funding.

Job description

Conduct root cause analyses to identify and remediate workflow and technology-related issues that result in loss of data quality.

Develop dashboards, visualizations, and presentations to summarize and explain data quality issues.

Advise stakeholders on data-related considerations in planning for: 1) technology, e.g., pipelines to move data into the surveillance system; and 2) operations, e.g., onboarding healthcare providers to health information exchange with NYC DOHMH.

Contribute to project coordination, management, and evaluation with a lens for data quality.

With an annual budget of $1.6 billion and more than 6,000 employees throughout the five boroughs, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) is one of the largest public health agencies in the world, serving 8 million New Yorkers from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. With over 200 years of leadership in the field, we're also one of our nation's oldest public health agencies. The challenges we face range from obesity, diabetes and heart disease to HIV/AIDS, tobacco addiction and substance abuse, and the threat of bioterrorism. We're tackling these issues with innovative policies and programs and getting exceptional results, but our work is never finished. The breadth of our innovative programs provides the widest range of choices for every member of our team.

Program Overview

The Division of Disease Control (DDC) at the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) is responsible for the identification, surveillance, treatment, control and prevention of infectious diseases in NYC.

Surveillance teams across the DDC bureaus collectively monitor and investigate over 90 reportable infectious diseases to detect, characterize, and respond to threats.

DDC continuously enhances its electronic systems in order to improve completeness of data and respond to emergent infectious agent threats (e.g., Zika virus, Ebola). More recently, DDC has embarked on an initiative to improve the interoperability of its surveillance informatics infrastructure by leveraging national health data standards. This will facilitate exchange with partners including healthcare providers, laboratories, health information exchanges (HIEs) such as the regional health information organizations (RHIOs), and other government agencies.

This person will advise DOHMH stakeholders to ensure that data quality issues are identified, documented, and resolved. Additionally, they will gain more knowledge of DOHMH surveillance by assisting in project coordination, management and evaluation as necessary.

The selected candidate will be an employee of Public Health Solutions (PHS), a non-profit organization that is the fiscal manager for DOHMH. This position is a 2 year position, paid for by 90/10 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act funding.

Job description

The selected candidate’s responsibilities will include but not be limited to:


Develop and implement automated or semi-automated scripts to analyze data quality and clean, enrich, map, and transform data to surveillance SME’s specifications.

Perform quality assurance and evaluate the completeness and accuracy of data received through electronic laboratory results and/or electronic case reporting.

Conduct root cause analyses to identify and remediate workflow and technology-related issues that result in loss of data quality.

Develop dashboards, visualizations, and presentations to summarize and explain data quality issues.

Advise stakeholders on data-related considerations in planning for: 1) technology, e.g., pipelines to move data into the surveillance system; and 2) operations, e.g., onboarding healthcare providers to health information exchange with NYC DOHMH.

Contribute to project coordination, management, and evaluation with a lens for data quality.
