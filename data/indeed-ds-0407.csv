Data Scientist,"Oakland, CA",Global Fishing Watch,$45 - $65 an hour,"Data Scientist – Global Fishing Watch
General Summary
Global Fishing Watch (GFW) is an independent, international non-profit organization that advances the sustainability and stewardship of the ocean by offering, for free, data and near real-time tracking of commercial fishing activity. We also support new science and research and we engage with governments, management organizations, and NGOs to advance the global dialogue on ocean transparency.
GFW processes a global database of vessel GPS positions, several terabytes in size, and applies machine learning models that infer each vessel’s type and size as well as when they are likely fishing. GFW is now developing new models, both on these GPS positions and on satellite imagery, to fully reveal activity in the world's oceans. These models include object detection from global feeds of satellite radar and optical imagery, and models that infer, based on vessel behavior, illegal activity and unreported catch. We believe that these new models have the potential to dramatically change the way we monitor and manage the world’s oceans.
We are looking for a data scientist to join our research and innovation team to help develop these models. This team works closely with external GFW academic partners to develop models and research, and also with the internal GFW engineering team to scale our methods and put them into production.
The Position
Working closely with the GFW technical teams, the data scientist will help organize data and build models to understand several global datasets that reveal human activity on the world’s oceans. The two key types of data are 1) vessel GPS data and 2) satellite imagery (both optical and radar). A strong ability to work in R or Python is required, as well as abilities to manipulate data in SQL.
The ideal candidate will be excited about working with global data, and will have a high aptitude for learning new techniques. Although it is obviously helpful, we do not expect that you already have a deep knowledge of building models or our key programming languages; we do expect that you have the aptitude to develop these skills and knowledge, and that you are excited about revealing human activity across the global ocean using these tools. Global Fishing Watch values working quickly, innovating, and working collaboratively. Our entire team works remotely, so the ideal candidate is able to manage their own time and be effective with limited daily oversight. Finally, we are passionate about producing research and datasets that will make a difference in how we manage the world’s oceans.
The exact projects the data scientist will focus on will depend on the candidate and other factors at GFW. Possible projects include:
Helping the machine learning engineers build models to identify fishing vessels from satellite and optical imagery -- experience with remote sensing, and especially synthetic aperture radar -- is helpful
Combining vessel detections from imagery with vessel GPS detections to identify vessels that are not broadcasting their locations
Developing models to estimate pollution from ocean going vessels, including noise pollution
Using vessel behavior to identify vessels that have an elevated risk of using forced labor or engaging in other illegal activity
Combing vessel tracking data with animal telemetry data (gps devices that have been attached to sharks and tunas) to build models to identify the likely catch and bycatch of ocean going vessels
Collaborating with the GFW engineering team to automate models.
Engaging with GFW Research Partners to develop these models and publish peer reviewed papers (the GFW Research Program has produced more than 20 academic papers, including many published at top journals)
Write blogs and present public visualizations

Join the Health Conscious Workplace of the Future
To make the world a healthier place, we started in our own backyard. We created a health-conscious environment that allows each of our employees to reach their own personal health goals. Below are a few of the employee-led programs that make working at Health IQ truly unique.
1. Nutritionally Supportive Environment
Anyone who has tried to stay healthy knows it’s hard to stick to your particular nutritional goals throughout the day with soda, chips, and sugary treats all around you. So we provide our employees with quality food and snack options, like a limitless supply of organic nuts, fruits, and veggies instead.
2. Optional Midday Fitness Time
Instead of the usual ping pong table, we’ve dedicated space for our employees to enjoy yoga, spin bikes, exercise equipment, and other wellness activities. Everyone gets 30 minutes each day to focus on their health – whether it’s time for a walk, using the exercise equipment, or daily meditation.
3. Casual Office Attire
Ever dream of coming to work in your casual fitness attire? Well, that's how we roll at Health IQ! Be comfortable and let your fitness fashion shine!
4. Like-Minded Coworkers
At the end of the day, we are a business-minded insurance company and we use analytics to measure our success and drive our business. Coming to work and working hard however is much more fun when you are surrounded by like-minded people who are motivated by the same personal goals as you. Our employees are making friends that will last a lifetime.
5. Motivate and Compete
Many of our employees are current or former athletes who are competitive and like to win. They motivate each other to do their personal best every day, and together we win as a team and as a company!
6. Excellent benefits
We pay 100% of our employees' costs toward medical, dental and vision insurance.

Is this Startup Going to Make It?
We think so. Our CEO sold his last company, Like.com, to Google for over $120MM. He was a board member or advisor to over $1B worth of startup exits to companies like Apple, Amazon, LinkedIn, etc. Past performance may not always guarantee future results, but we like our odds. We’ve grown from 23 people to over 200 people between our three locations (Mountain View, San Diego and Dallas). This isn’t because we are spending some of the $140MM+ in financing we received like drunken sailors (in fact we are pretty frugal). This is because our revenues have been doubling almost every month since we started selling policies in January of 2016, and now we are one of the fastest growing online insurance companies and were recently named to Wealthfront's List of Top Companies to Launch a Career during 2019 and recently for 2020!
Health IQ believes that everyone has the ability to make an impact, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer committed to providing employment opportunity regardless of sex, race, creed, color, gender, religion, marital status, domestic partner status, age, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, pregnancy, military or veteran status, citizenship status, and genetic information.

Join the Health Conscious Workplace of the Future
To make the world a healthier place, we started in our own backyard. We created a health-conscious environment that allows each of our employees to reach their own personal health goals. Below are a few of the employee-led programs that make working at Health IQ truly unique.
1. Personalized Lunch Program
A healthy diet is never one-size-fits-all. That's why every person who works onsite at Health IQ gets to order their own custom-built lunch every day. That way, whether you're vegan, low-carb, dairy-free, or just craving salmon, you can customize the perfect lunch for your unique dietary needs.
2. Nutritionally Supportive Environment
Anyone who has tried to stay healthy knows it’s hard to stick to your particular nutritional goals throughout the day with soda, chips, and sugary treats all around you. So we provide our employees with quality food and snack options, like a limitless supply of organic nuts, fruits, and veggies instead.
3. Optional Midday Fitness Time
Instead of the usual ping pong table, we’ve dedicated space for our employees to enjoy yoga, spin bikes, exercise equipment, and other wellness activities. Everyone gets 30 minutes each day to focus on their health – whether it’s time for a walk, using the exercise equipment, or daily meditation.
4. Casual Office Attire
Ever dream of coming to work in your casual fitness attire? Well, that's how we roll at Health IQ! Be comfortable and let your fitness fashion shine!
5. Like-Minded Coworkers
At the end of the day, we are a business-minded insurance company and we use analytics to measure our success and drive our business. Coming to work and working hard however is much more fun when you are surrounded by like-minded people who are motivated by the same personal goals as you. Our employees are making friends that will last a lifetime.
6. Motivate and Compete
Many of our employees are current or former athletes who are competitive and like to win. They motivate each other to do their personal best every day, and together we win as a team and as a company!
7. Excellent benefits
We pay 100% of our employees' costs toward medical, dental and vision insurance. We even have a masseuse on-site and allow employees to schedule up to 2 massages each month!
Join our team!
Is this Startup Going to Make It?
We think so. Our CEO sold his last company, Like.com, to Google for over $120MM. He was a board member or advisor to over $1B worth of startup exits to companies like Apple, Amazon, LinkedIn, etc. Past performance may not always guarantee future results, but we like our odds. We’ve grown from 23 people to over 200 people between our three locations (Mountain View, San Diego and Dallas). This isn’t because we are spending some of the $140MM+ in financing we received like drunken sailors (in fact we are pretty frugal). This is because our revenues have been doubling almost every month since we started selling policies in January of 2016, and now we are one of the fastest growing online insurance companies and were recently named to Wealthfront's List of Top Companies to Launch a Career during 2019 and recently for 2020!
Health IQ believes that everyone has the ability to make an impact, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer committed to providing employment opportunity regardless of sex, race, creed, color, gender, religion, marital status, domestic partner status, age, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, pregnancy, military or veteran status, citizenship status, and genetic information.

And you’ll have fun doing it. Join a company of individuals with hopes, plans and passions, all using and developing our talents for good, at work and in life. Summary
Risk analytics spans a broad set of empirically-based disciplines (applied statistics, applied econometrics, applied mathematics, algorithmics / optimization, and machine learning / data science) applied to and across all the major risk silos (credit, market, operational, underwriting, liquidity, and model risk). We are seeking experts in these fields to apply their training and experience to optimize risk-and-return business decisions in the Performance and Analytics team within Allstate’s Enterprise Risk and Return Management group. The Risk Analytics Data Scientist is responsible for aligning with and contributing to corporate objectives by identifying and developing non-siloed, cross-disciplinary solutions that will enable Allstate to generate profitable market share growth. He/she is accountable for using data and non-trivial statistical/econometric code that in most circumstances, seamlessly and directly translates into material business decisions for the firm. This includes developing original-yet-defensible methods for efficient and effective risk transfer and risk allocation, as well as building predictive models that enable Allstate to make better decisions and win in the marketplace.

We believe that developing ourselves and our colleagues is the best investment Allstate can make. To this end the Performance and Analytics Group 1) sponsors symposiums including topics we develop and apply in our work, such as the capital consequences of algorithm choice when enforcing positive definiteness; new and innovative approaches to extreme value theory with a focus on heavy-tailed distributions; VECM, granger causality, and impulse indicator models for forecasting in scenario analytics and stress testing; and measuring tail dependence in large portfolios with diverse marginals; and 2) strongly encourages and funds attendance of relevant practitioner and academic conferences. Job Description
This role is responsible for leading the use of data to make risk-and-return analytics decisions, with some focus on liquidity risk. This includes, more broadly, the development and management of predictive modeling and the design and development and vetting of original methodology. We place a premium on statistical/econometric empirically-based coding expertise in at least one major relevant language (e.g. SAS, Matlab, Python, R, C++) as this will serve as the basis by which the abovementioned business decisions are made. More specifically, this role will leverage the candidate’s e xperience with various approaches – both established and derived, original methods – to estimating and managing the major risk types to effectively and efficiently drive capital decisions. We highly value a very strong curiosity factor in exploring / understanding datasets containing covariates with complex relationships, appropriately tempered by the need for provable rigor and scientifically defensible and replicable methods based on modular, transparent, and well-documented code. This role will manage complex projects and require some mentoring as it will have direct reports.

The hiring team can consider individuals located across the United States and will allow for this employee to be home-based with the expectation of regular travel to our Northbrook, IL headquarters. Responsibilities
Uses best practices to implement and develop advanced statistical, econometric, and machine learning techniques to build risk analytics models that directly address material business needs. Familiarity with copulas and related methods is highly relevant.
Incorporates independent replication and model validation methods into the model development process and understands the necessity for this, as well as the extreme efficiency gains that result from this best practice.
Knowledge of multiplicity/FDR issues and the ability and expertise to avoid overfitting. Familiarity, if not expertise with regularization methods is highly relevant.
The ability to boil down, without dumbing down, is critical: communicates effectively to team members, leadership and stakeholders on findings to ensure models are well understood and incorporated into business processes. Provides stakeholders the opportunity to influence the direction of the work via feedback loops.
Develop and execute non-siloed, cross-disciplinary solutions to complex, non-textbook business challenges.
Works on data and complex business problems to drive improved risk-and-return business decisions and results by designing, building, and partnering to implement the right models for the right problems (e.g. Hadoop is not necessary (or desirable) for mere gigabytes of data, and random forests is not necessary (or desirable) when OLS conditions are sufficiently met).
Can identify new areas of data, research and methodology for solving relevant risk-and-return business challenges.
Collaborates the with team to understand the business’ problems to identify the optimal methodological, and modeling (method+language/platform), approaches.
Mentors and develops junior data scientists. Qualifications
Master’s or PhD degree or concentration in a quantitative field such as statistics, econometrics/economics, data science, applied mathematics, computer science, and/or finance.
Peer reviewed publications & related awards are highly valued / desired, as are technical conference decks.
Academic honors, top standardized test scores, scholarships and fellowships are highly valued / desired.
Serving as referee / reviewer / editor of academic and industry journals is highly valued / desired.

About Us VIDEO ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohREsVH5ND8&feature=youtu.be )

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:

Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.

Data Scientist,"Fort Worth, TX",NT Concepts,None,"OVERVIEW
Who We Are
We’re NT Concepts, a leading provider of business and technology solutions for the intelligence and national security communities! Our team of engineers, subject matter experts, and data scientists provide experienced, high-quality Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity engineering and innovation support. We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solveproblems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.
RESPONSIBILITIES
And… Why We’re Both Here - This “Job” Thing
Here it is: we have some opportunities. And we’d like to get to know some more amazing people, that might want to talk about that. People like you. Since you’re reading this, and the title’s “data scientist,” we’re thinking you might be a little interested. Very cool.
We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. We've got some tricky time-series data on this particular project and are looking for creative minds in the deep learning space to tackle it. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
QUALIFICATIONS
Who You Are
Okay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:
Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
You've got experience with deep learning.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.
We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets

We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.

You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

Sr. Data Analyst / Data Scientist,"New York, NY",Splice.com,None,"About Splice
------------

We're building a creative ecosystem for music producers. With this ecosystem, we're cultivating a global community of creators that fosters inspiration, connection, focus, and growth.

Our work environment is no different. We champion collaboration, big ideas, helping where we can and asking for assistance when we need it. We aim for steady, measured expansion through experimentation and iteration. We encourage optimism, inclusion, and transparency in the workplace. We aren't afraid to stumble, because every stumble can teach us something about our processes, strategies, and even ourselves.

We don't just hire people who mirror our culture. We hire people who add to it.

About the role
--------------

We are looking for a Senior Analyst / Data Scientist to join our growing Data and Insights team. Initially, this role will work closely with Marketing, helping them to level up their already strong use of data in strategic planning as well as tactical decision making. In time, there's potential for this role to support other organizations within Splice.

Our ideal candidate should have expertise building data models, visualizations, and analyses used by marketers. They should know how to use data to support the optimization of marketing campaigns and spend. They should have experience distilling the customer journey into actionable insights. They should have built a variety of attribution models (and know the relative tradeoffs of each). They should have experience with user segmentation. They should have experience conducting impact analyses and have a solid understanding of experimental design. Perhaps most importantly, this person should excel at and enjoy teaching others how to use and interpret data.

Skills we're looking for
------------------------

Metric creation
---------------

This individual will be responsible for taking in loosely structured problems or objectives and devising useful metrics that drive us toward solutions. This person needs to ask the right questions to understand how these metrics will be used in decision making—in a sense, choosing the optimal methodology while also thoughtfully constructing scalable and intuitive user interfaces for whatever metric or analysis is built.

Data manipulation
-----------------

In our opinion, things that can be reasonably expressed in SQL, ought to be. We expect our Senior Analyst / Data Scientist to have strong analytical SQL skills that go beyond basic select statements. This means a fluidity constructing statements that rely on a combination of joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions.

Analysis
--------

Right now, our bias is toward models that can be interpreted to drive human action. We're seeking an individual who enjoys conducting statistical analyses—someone who knows how to interpret their models in layperson terms, translating what they see in the data into useful policy suggestions.

Tooling expectations
--------------------

Strong experience with analytical SQL (ideally using BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, or a similar MPP data-warehouse technology).
Regular usage of a scripting language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning, such as Python, R, or Julia.
Hands-on experience with a self-service BI/query/visualization tools, such as Looker, Tableau, Mode, Periscope/Sisense, or similar. (Bonus points for Looker.)
Training in statistics or econometrics, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methods.
Exposure to data sets commonly used by B2C Product and Marketing teams. This includes ads data (Facebook, Google, Twitter); event data (Google Analytics 360, Snowplow, Segment); and normalized databases that store transactional data.
Additional comments
-------------------

We may ask you to demonstrate your understanding of how to securely handle data and secrets in the programs you write. Customer privacy and data security are extremely important to us at Splice.

There are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, we'll flesh out what you've built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.

As a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is an asset. If this topic is new to you, that's okay—you should be open to learning about it.

Geospatial Data Scientist,"Detroit, MI","Airspace Link, Inc.",None,"Hello!

Airspace Link, Inc. is hiring a Geospatial Data Scientist to help build the data used to manage local airspace, commercial drone logistics, and beyond visual line of sight operations. Yes, the jetsonian-future is finally upon us and we need help creating the future of unmanned aerial vehicles!

This is a role for someone with experience manipulating large and diverse datasets with the know-how to coax data diamonds out of the rough. This is the first offering of this type within our organization and will report to the CTO.

Airspace Link is headquartered out of Detroit, MI with a remote office in northern Utah. We’d love for candidates to be centered in these geographic regions but understand that the best person for the job may live somewhere else. In short, the right remote candidates are considered, however Detroit based candidates will be given preference. International candidates are not considered at this time.

We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are eager to further diversify our company. Airspace Link is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.

About The Job

The Geospatial Data Scientist will be part of an agile team responsible for deriving risk associated with the potential of drone operational failures. The more these vehicles go up, the more likely they'll come down, and our mission is to build the best probability models in the industry. Risk can be quantified by a wide range of external influencers, including both predictable and unpredictable (e.g. weather) aerial and ground-based factors.

If you're digging the autonomous future, this role is for you. You will be directly influencing the ability for autonomous drone operations to be a successful national integration, instead of a tragic news headline.

You'll be working with a diverse set of authoritative geospatial data provided through our clients, in conjunction with public and other 3rd-party datasets to help build our data product and solution offerings.

Your output will be shared via application programming interfaces (API), web and mobile applications, single-use digital maps and reports, or even simple internal spreadsheets. We'll ask you to participate in the preparation and staging of the data across a range of computing solutions.

Automation will play an important role in the success of this position as well. Can you scale the probability of an autonomous aerial vehicle striking a human or vehicle in any geography in the nation?

About You

Everyone at Airspace Link is here to do the best work of their career, so we work on systemic problems and try to avoid individual blame. We're committed generalists, eager learners, consciences workers and curators of what's essential.

We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous debate, but we remember that we’re here for the same purpose: do go good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.

You'll be expected to come to the table with commercial and academic experience in data science, data mining, statistics (including probability theory), graph algorithms, machine learning, and spatial optimization. That's to say, there will be alot of hard problems to solve and you'll need a strong and diverse toolbox to get the work done. As an expert, you'll be expected to recommend and execute on overall modeling strategies with confidence and a well conceived notion on how to succeed.

You are thoughtful in the evaluation of your models, improving them over time as they interact with real users.

Some of the bullet points:
Proficiency with Esri software suite, including raster analytics
Strong analytic, cartographic, and presentation skills
Ability to develop robust data queries using SQL
Graduate level competency in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or equivalent scientific field
Some experience with cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, etc)
Excellent coding skills, especially in Python or R

About Our Pay & Benefits

Airspace Link, by all definitions, is a startup. Some of you may look on our status like you would at grabbing the last Walmart shopping cart with the askew front wheel. Others will view this as a unique opportunity in a greenfield industry with huge potential upside. We hope you’re the latter.

We aim to be competitive but won’t be making any headlines [yet]. We offer a full health benefit package that is tiered depending on your tenure with Airspace Link. In other words, our benefits move from good, to better, to best.

We support a life well lived away from work. None of our benefits are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours, ample vacation time, fitness, wellness, and healthy living.

How To Apply

Please send an application tailored to this position that speaks to us. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Show us the future.

We value good communication and solid writing is part of that. We expect to see a well-constructed cover letter along with your professional history. Forget the generic resume (and it's so blatantly obvious). There's no prize for being first. Copy and paste doesn't make it very far and we strongly encourage you to take this part of the application process seriously.

Machine Learning is a critical part of Adobe’s Cloud offering. Adobe Clouds enable customers to create and manage digital content, such as assets, composites, 3D, documents etc., and digital experience and transformations.

Creative Cloud is focused on visual imagination and creation, and includes such well-known products as Photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, Lightroom CC, and Adobe Stock. Document Cloud is centered around the creation and management of textual documents, including Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign. Experience Cloud is the set of offerings for the large-scale enterprise, covering marketing, advertising, and analytics.

We are building new machine learning platform, called Adobe Sensei, that powers machine learning and AI across all of these Adobe Cloud product lines. This platform will enable thousands of applied researchers, millions of users, and billions of content pieces. The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe!

A crucial piece of developing machine learning solutions is the evaluation process. How do we know the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use for judging them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products – for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?

Equally core to the ML process is the training set itself. Such training sets often include human judgments, elicted at large scale, which form the target that the ML process predicts.

How can you participate? We’re looking for data scientists to define, drive, and coordinate evaluation and training set construction for the Applied Machine Learning team at Adobe. This will involve thinking hard about product quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and the capabilities of both A/B tests and human-judgment tasks to produce training sets for ML as well as quantitative evaluations that measure how well our AI/ML algorithms are doing their jobs

Responsibilities:
Work closely with product, research, and engineering leaders to understand ML applications and define success
Design evaluation tasks and guidelines for human judgment to measure the performance of machine-learned and other advanced algorithms.
Design human judgment tasks that will create training sets for useful machine-learned models.
Create a winning culture built on collaboration and shared accomplishments- have fun along the way!
Qualifications:
BS or MS in a technical field (Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics) OR in a human-centered field such as Psychology, Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction.
Exposure to applied machine learning in an industrial setting
Experience in validation and evaluation of machine learned models
Strong quantitative orientation
Understanding of issues around ground truth and training sets for ML, including human judgment and A/B testing
Hands-on experience using third-party judgment services such as Crowdflower, Appen, or Amazon Mechanical Turk

Responsibilities
The incumbent interacts with principal investigators and their delegates to update, and test appropriate mathematical models, and to design procedures consistent with those models. The incumbent's principal duty is scientific applications programming and analysis, which involves the implementation and testing of algorithms to simulate or solve acoustic and related problems, using simulated and experimental data and modern computing methodologies (e.g. machine learning, data mining).
The incumbent is required to use mathematical skills in numerical analysis and computer science as well as physical understanding of acoustic propagation to implement and test acoustic propagation and data processing algorithms on large, high-speed, highly optimized computers. The incumbent is required to understand and be proficient in scientific programming languages (including C, Matlab, etc.), have the ability to learn other required languages, and is required to be proficient in using the Branch and operational computer systems (Windows, Linux, Cray) so as to obtain the maximum execution speed and efficiency for the large-scale acoustic and system models that are the primary product of the section.
This position requires knowledge of the basic principles of wave phenomena, and the development and implementation of appropriate computer models.
Applied mathematicians use mathematical theories and procedures, like modeling and computational methods, to find solutions and formulas to business; government; engineering; and physical, life, and social science problems. Industry relies on applied mathematics for the design and development of products such as computers, cars, communication systems, textiles and prescription drugs. Applied mathematics is at the heart of processes and services such as supply chains, logistics and production scheduling. Advances in science and technology in areas such as information technology, climatology, biological sciences, economic modeling and environmental emissions modeling, have resulted from the use of mathematic techniques. Mathematics is the study of the measurement, properties, and relationships of quantities and sets, using numbers and symbols. Mathematicians use tools such as mathematical theory, well-defined procedures called algorithms, and the latest computer technology to solve economic, scientific, engineering, physics, and business problems. Mathematics is divided into two areas: theoretical, or pure, mathematics, and applied mathematics. However, these two areas often overlap. Mathematicians doing applied work use the theories and laws developed by theoretical mathematicians. Applied mathematicians solve specific problems in such fields as physical science, social science, business, computer science, government, biology, and engineering. They may work in the electronics industry developing new kinds of computers and software. Applied mathematicians sometimes study numerical information about medical problems, such as the effect of a new drug on a disease. Applied mathematics is a subset of mathematics where a mathematician uses mathematical principles to solve applied problems. Business analytics are heavily reliant on evaluating numerical-based outcomes of business operations. Those in the field also work with sophisticated models that require an understanding of logistic regression modeling techniques for application into loss forecasting and risk strategies.

Background
Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.
But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.
At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.

This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.
