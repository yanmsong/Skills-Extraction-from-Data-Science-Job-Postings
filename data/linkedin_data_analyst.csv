These are Live IndyEast (Develop Affordable Housing and Redevelopment), Work IndyEast (Create Jobs), Buy IndyEast (Increase Economic Activity), Learn IndyEast (Improve Educational Opportunities) and Safe IndyEast (Reduce Serious and Violent Crime). Each goal contains three sub-goals, along with clearly identified activities and interventions. Over the next several years, JBNC, along with neighborhood residents and implementation partners will work to carry out the activities and interventions while leveraging new opportunities.
